Week 3 Challenge:

Objective: Build a blog website with 7 pages minimum!

Organization:

Hold all files in a specific labelled folder

css
html
js

Processs:
	
Home Page
	On the home page I create a carousel of cards that switches between three different cards on a stopwatch bases
	Each of the three cards leads to a respective article.
		
	Below the carousel of cards I create more cards displaying extra articles that will not have their own pages.

	Give the Home Page a navbar
	The NavBar will have a home button, a profile button and drop down list of articles called "Articles"
	Link each button to the respective page.

Profile Page
	After completing the home page I will move on to the profile page
	I will create two categories one for the creator of the website(ME) and another for some of the creators of the articles
	
	Create a Website Creator Category
	Create a card from bootstrap and input all the prompts such as image, title and description
	Finally add a list in the card which holds personal info links such as github, linkedin and facebook

Articles
	Each article category pages will virtually be the same.
	
	Create two cards that give a brief description of the article, date and title of the article.
	After that make it so once the card is clicked on the website stops displaying the cards and rather displays the contents of the article that was clicked on.
	Do that 10 times, 2 times per category.
